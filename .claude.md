# Claude Code Configuration - Gdansk LoL Development Hub

## Development Rules

### 1. No Emojis in Code
- **Rule**: Never add emojis to code files (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, etc.)
- **Why**: Keep code professional, clean, and free from unicode issues
- **Exception**: Emojis ARE allowed in user-facing text (activity feeds, notifications, UI labels)
- **Examples**:
  - ❌ Bad: `console.log("✅ API call succeeded")`
  - ✅ Good: `console.log("[SUCCESS] API call succeeded")`
  - ✅ Good: Activity feed showing "🎉 Wojtek climbed to Emerald!" (user-facing content)

### 2. Explore, Plan, Code Methodology
Always follow this three-step workflow:

#### Step 1: EXPLORE
- Research and understand requirements thoroughly
- Read existing code and documentation
- Analyze API responses and data structures
- Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
- Use Task tool with Plan subagent for complex exploration

#### Step 2: PLAN
- Present a detailed implementation plan
- Use ExitPlanMode tool to get user approval
- Include: files to create/modify, approach, potential issues
- Wait for explicit approval before coding
- Never skip this step, even for "simple" changes

#### Step 3: CODE
- Only execute after plan approval
- Follow the approved plan exactly
- Update todos as work progresses
- Communicate any deviations from plan

**Important**: If user is in plan mode, NEVER make file changes without approval. Always present plan first.

## Project-Specific Context

### Project Overview
**Gdansk LoL Development Hub** - League of Legends talent network for Poland with physical presence in Gdansk.

### Business Strategy
- **Geographic Scope**: All of Poland (not just Gdansk)
- **Acquisition**: Free signup via Polish Discord communities (solves cold start problem)
- **Validation Hub**: Gdansk with physical presence (Kinguin Lounge partnership, tournaments)
- **Expansion Model**: Start Poland-wide digitally, add physical hubs in other cities later

**Why This Works:**
- Discord = free user acquisition at scale
- Gdansk = prove local engagement model works
- Poland focus = manageable market, clear identity
- Tournament integration = recurring engagement

### Key Constraints
- **Launch**: Friday this week (MVP spec provided)
- **Budget**: $0 for first 3-6 months (MVP validation phase)
- **Initial Scale**: 15-20 mock players for demo → 100+ real players week 1 via Discord
- **Focus**: Ranked Solo/Duo games ONLY (queue 420)
- **Region**: EUW for testing, EUNE for production (Poland is EUNE)
- **Audience**: Polish League players, local teams, Kinguin Lounge Gdansk

### Tech Stack (MVP This Week)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vercel hosting
- **Backend**: Mock data in JSON files for Friday launch, Python + GitHub Actions later
- **Database**: Mock data → Supabase migration after validation
- **API**: Riot Games API (integrate after Friday demo)
- **Design**: Dark gaming aesthetic (#0A0E27 background, Kinguin orange/electric blue accents)

### MVP Spec (Launch Friday)

#### Pages to Build:
1. **Homepage** (`/`)
   - Hero: "GDAŃSK LEAGUE HUB - Track Rankings • Find Teams • Compete Locally"
   - Current season stats box (87 players, 12 teams, next tournament)
   - **Live Activity Feed** (KEY DIFFERENTIATOR):
     - "🎉 Wojtek climbed to Emerald this week - now #5 in Gdańsk!"
     - "🔥 Team 'Five Penguins' won 8 games in a row"
     - "📈 Gdańsk average rank increased 2 divisions this month"
   - Top 20 Leaderboard preview (clickable to full leaderboard)

2. **Player Profile** (`/player/[name]`)
   - Profile header (avatar, name, rank, role)
   - Stats overview (W-L, peak rank, improvement, most played)
   - **Unique Insights** (DIFFERENTIATOR):
     - Mental Resilience Score (bounce-back rate after losses)
     - Performance analysis (best times to play, team synergy)
     - Death heatmap (positioning weaknesses)
     - Gdansk comparison (CS@10, KP%, vision vs local avg)
   - Tournament history

3. **Regions/Coverage** (`/regions`)
   - Interactive Poland map
   - Gdansk: 87 players (green/active)
   - Other cities: "Coming Soon" (grayed out)
   - Vision statement: "Cover all major Polish cities by 2025"

4. **Tournaments** (`/tournaments`)
   - Upcoming: Kinguin Gdansk Monthly Open (Nov 15, prize pool, registration)
   - Past results with highlights
   - Regional tournament calendar

5. **About** (`/about`)
   - Vision statement
   - Kinguin partnership
   - How to join
   - Contact info

#### Mock Data Strategy:
- **15-20 player profiles** with Polish names (Maciej, Anna, Wojtek, Kasia, Piotr, etc.)
- **Rank distribution**: 2 Master+, 4 Diamond, 6 Emerald/Plat, 5 Gold
- **Realistic stats**: 50-65% win rates, varied champion pools, recent match history
- **Timestamps**: "Last updated: 3h ago" to show freshness
- **Some inactive players**: "No games in 2 weeks" for realism
- **Activity feed**: 10-15 recent events (promotions, win streaks, team updates)
- **Tournaments**: 2-3 with realistic Polish prize pools (1,000 zł Kinguin credit)

#### Files Structure:
```
gdansk-lol-development/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx (Homepage)
│   ├── player/[name]/page.tsx (Player profiles)
│   ├── regions/page.tsx (Poland map)
│   ├── tournaments/page.tsx (Tournament hub)
│   └── about/page.tsx (Vision)
├── data/
│   ├── players.json (15-20 mock players)
│   ├── activity-feed.json (10-15 events)
│   └── tournaments.json (2-3 tournaments)
├── components/ (Reusable UI)
└── public/ (Assets, Poland map SVG)
```

### Database Schema (Post-MVP)
- **Core tables**: players, matches, match_participants
- **Enhanced tables**: match_participant_runes, match_timeline_snapshots
- **Storage**: ~4 MB for 100 players (well within free tier)
- **Poland-wide**: Can scale to 1,000+ players (~40 MB)

### Design System
- **Colors**:
  - Background: `#0A0E27` (dark navy)
  - Accent: Kinguin orange (`#FF6B35`) or electric blue (`#00D4FF`)
  - Success: Green (`#10B981`)
  - Cards: Subtle gradients with borders
- **Typography**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for stats
- **Aesthetic**: Dark, modern, esports-inspired
- **Mobile-first**: Works on 320px+ screens

### Key Differentiators

What makes this different from OP.GG/U.GG:

1. **Polish Context** - "#5 in Gdańsk" not "#42,000 EUNE"
2. **Activity Feed** - Social layer showing community momentum
3. **Mental Resilience Scoring** - Bounce-back analysis after losses
4. **Local Tournaments** - Physical events at Kinguin Lounge
5. **Team Formation** - Help players find local teammates
6. **Death Heatmaps** - Positioning coaching (unique insight)
7. **Performance Timing** - "You play better on weekday evenings"

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/React (MVP Focus)
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Functional components with hooks
- Server components by default (Next.js 14 App Router)
- Named exports preferred
- No emojis in console.logs or variable names
- Emojis OK in JSX for user-facing content

### File Organization
```typescript
// Good component structure
export default function PlayerProfile({ params }: { params: { name: string } }) {
  // Server component - fetch data here
  const player = getPlayerData(params.name);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Clean, semantic JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Tailwind CSS
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Create reusable components for repeated patterns
- Dark theme by default
- Mobile-first breakpoints: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`

### Mock Data Format
```json
// data/players.json
{
  "players": [
    {
      "id": "maciej-midgodpl",
      "name": "Maciej",
      "summonerName": "MidGodPL",
      "rank": "Master",
      "lp": 156,
      "leaderboardRank": 1,

          "games": 87,
          "winRate": 61
        }
      },
      "insights": {
        "mentalResilience": 7.8,
        "bestTime": "Weekday evenings (61% WR)",
        "improvement": "+4 divisions since Aug"
      },
      "lastUpdated": "2h ago"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Git Commits
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`
- Be descriptive: `feat: add player profile page with mock data`
- Include Claude co-author (auto-added)

## When to Use Plan Mode

Always use plan mode (present ExitPlanMode) for:
- Creating new pages or features
- Modifying data structures
- Adding new dependencies
- Architectural decisions
- Database migrations (post-MVP)

Can skip plan mode for:
- Fixing typos
- Updating mock data
- Styling adjustments
- Documentation updates
- Read-only exploration
